## Project description

Create ansible roles and scripts to harden Redhat 7/8 and CentOS 7/8, especially for the usage on AWS and GCP. The project is tested with inspec with below two profiles:

* dev-sec linux baseline - https://github.com/dev-sec/linux-baseline
* dev-sec cis-dil-benchmark - https://github.com/dev-sec/cis-dil-benchmark

---

## HOWTO

### To run on AWS EC2 or GCE instance locally (Apply for RHEL7 and RHEL8):

* Start an instance with 4 extra volume (If you don't care about the mount point CIS-DIL items, you can start with the default 1 single volume image)

* Install git
```
sudo yum install git
```

* Pull the project from bitbucket

* Run below to move /home, /var, /var/log and /var/log/audit to the volumes and reboot (If you don't care about the mount point CIS-DIL items, skip this step)
```
scripts/move_dir.sh 
```

* After system is up, install ansible and ansible galaxy roles

* Run baseline hardening
```
ansible-playbook ansible/server_baseline_hardening.yml
```

* Run below to verify baseline
```
sudo CHEF_LICENSE=accept inspec exec https://github.com/dev-sec/linux-baseline 
```

* Run cis-dil hardening
```
ansible-playbook ansible/server_cisdil_hardening.yml
```

* Run below script to remount /var/tmp (It will be persistent after reload)
```
scripts/vartmp_mount.sh
```

* Run below to verify cls-dil
```
sudo CHEF_LICENSE=accept inspec exec https://github.com/dev-sec/cis-dil-benchmark
```

## Known issues

* The daemon tcpd/tcp_wrapper is depreciated on Redhat and CentOS 8. Hence the respective cis-dil test fails with below message:
```
  ×  cis-dil-benchmark-3.4.1: Ensure TCP Wrappers is installed (2 failed)
     ×  System Package tcpd is expected to be installed
     ×  System Package tcp_wrappers is expected to be installed
```

* The output syntax of sestatus (SELinus Status) has changed since Redhat/CentOS 7. The test in cis-dil is using the Redhat 6 output for parsing and hence fails with below message:
```
 ×  cis-dil-benchmark-1.6.1.3: Ensure SELinux policy is configured (1 failed)
     ×  Command: `sestatus` stdout is expected to match /Policy from config file:\s+(targeted|mls)/
```
Below is the respective output from Redhat 7 and onward.
```
     Loaded policy name:             targeted
```

* GCE VM uses vFAT for boot partition format, and disabling FAT will corrupt the VM reboot. Hence the related fix and check are disabled in Ansible role. Below error messages are returned by cis-dil.
```
  ×  cis-dil-benchmark-1.1.1.8: Ensure mounting of FAT filesystems is disabled (2 failed)
     ×  Kernel Module vfat is expected not to be loaded
     ×  Kernel Module vfat is expected to be disabled
```

* This Ansible role fixes /var/tmp mount point with proper security settings and updates /etc/fstab for persistent behaviours. However the adhoc mount does not work properly, which seems to be an underlying issue of Ansible. Run the script scripts/vartmp_mount.sh to ad-hoc mount after playbook execution. 

* The tests in cis-dil mandate /home, /var, /var/log and /var/log/audit to be mounted to dedicated partition. If you don't care about it as the nature that Cloud VM is ephemeral, you may skip the steps to move them to the new volumes. Below messages will be returned as a result:
```
  ×  cis-dil-benchmark-1.1.6: Ensure separate partition exists for /var
     ×  Mount /var is expected to be mounted
  ×  cis-dil-benchmark-1.1.11: Ensure separate partition exists for /var/log
     ×  Mount /var/log is expected to be mounted
  ×  cis-dil-benchmark-1.1.12: Ensure separate partition exists for /var/log/audit
     ×  Mount /var/log/audit is expected to be mounted
  ×  cis-dil-benchmark-1.1.13: Ensure separate partition exists for /home
     ×  Mount /home is expected to be mounted
  ×  cis-dil-benchmark-1.1.14: Ensure nodev option set on /home partition
     ×  Mount /home options is expected to include "nodev"
```

## Workaround

* An empty GRUB password is added by this Ansible roles to pass the respective cis-dil test. It won't reduce the security of Cloud VM as the boot menu is not accessible.
